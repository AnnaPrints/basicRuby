# RubyMine debugger test project

## What is this project?

Project is a compilation of examples from rubykoans, changes between ruby versions (since 2.4) and some important
examples that the debugger already had problems with.

## How to test debugger with this project?
To test the debugger, you can use this project like this:
- In [basic_ruby](basic_ruby) folder:
  1. Walk through all the files and test the debugger with methods starting with `test_`
  2. Pay attention to what these methods call, the method names, and set the breakpoint accordingly.

- In [changes_by_versions](changes_by_versions) folder:
  1.  Go through all the files and make sure the major changes from previous versions of ruby still work correctly.
